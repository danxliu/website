        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Daniel Liu, and I'm a Senior at UC Berkeley majoring in
          Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. At school, I'm a member
          of the <a href="https://ocf.io" target="_blank"
            >Open Computing Facility</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, swimming, and table tennis. I play
          way too many games, mostly fps or open world games (1v1 me <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/"
            >straftat</a
          >). I could also be working on my homelab or rewriting my Linux
          dotfiles again.
