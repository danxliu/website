I recently switched to light mode on my daily driving laptop after being a dark mode user for basically the entirety of my life.

Recently my battery life on my gaming laptop has dropped so far that I have had to lower the brightness to 10% to get it to survive the hour and a half lectures.
Dark mode windows just weren't very readable with that brightness.

Switching to light mode makes it so much easier to read the laptop screen, and since my laptop is IPS the backlight will be on no matter if its dark or light mode so light mode doesn't waste more battery.

Also there is something nice about light windows with dark shadows against a light background idk.

My terminal stays dark mode though.

(UPDATE: I have switched my terminal and code editors to light mode as of 02/16/2026.)
